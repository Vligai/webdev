	<h1>That Time Charlie Went to a Mysterious Mountain</h1>
	<main>
	<p> 
	Once upon a time Charlie was peacefully sleeping at home, when two of his friends rudely woke him up.
	They were inviting him to go on the adventure of his lifetime. He didn't like them very much, in fact,
	he hated them, so he refused. However, they were so persistent that in the end he caved in.
	</p>
	<p>
	They led Charlie to the middle of the forest, where they found a dinosaur laying on a big rock, who was
	supposed to guide them towards the mysterious montain. Charlie was shocked, because he never saw a dinosaur before.
	Dinosaur roared and his friends claimed that they understood the creature and that he told them the way to the mountain
	was through that shaky bridge. Bridge looked like it was going to fall apart from any slight contact, but it was
	much sturdier that it seemed. After Charlie and his friends crossed the bridge they finally reached a Mysterious Mountain.
	Charlie noticed that something is wrong with that mountain and at a closer look he realized that it was made of candy.
	Suddenly, 5 strange creatures jumped out of the cave in the mountain and started to sing, inviting Charlie to go in the cave.
	Charlie was exhausted from the walk and wanted this adventure to be over, so without wasting time he made his way inside the cave.
	As soon as he walked in, the entrance of the cave started to close and he was trapped before he realized it.
	He was screaming for help, but his friends have abandoned him. While he was trying to find a way out,
	he was hit at the back of his head and has lost consciousness.
	</p>
	<p>
	Next day, when Charlie woke up, he thought it was just a dream, but then he realized that it wasn't, because
	he noticed that he was missing a kidney.
